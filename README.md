This repository is for a React practice project developed between January 12 - 22, 2020. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
You can download a zip file, fork this project, or clone with HTTPS.

## Built with
* React
* Javascript
* Webpack
* CSS

## Development
### Create React App
The project's build configuration was initialized with "[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app?utm_source=katdelormegithub&utm_medium=github "Create React App")". This way you donâ€™t need to install or configure webpack. It'll be preconfigured and hidden.

To create a new app, choose the method you prefer:
`npx create-react-app app-name` or `npm init react-app app-name` or `yarn create react-app app-name`

`cd app-name`

### Start
`npm start`

It will open in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Additional Available Scripts
You can also run with Yarn or another option of your choice.
`yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
