## Development
### Create React App
The project's build configuration was initialized with "[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app?utm_source=katdelormegithub&utm_medium=github "Create React App")". This way you donâ€™t need to install or configure webpack. It'll be preconfigured and hidden.

`npx create-react-app app-name` or `npm init react-app app-name` or `yarn create react-app app-name`

`cd app-name`

It will open in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
